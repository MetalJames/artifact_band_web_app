        earlyYearsAndLineup: "Artifact, a Ukrainian thrash metal band founded in 2005, started as a four-member group with a vision of blending heavy and thrash metal into a modernized, high-energy sound. While the band initially experimented with both styles, its identity leaned toward thrash metal—though early compositions still carried elements of classic heavy metal. \n\nAt the beginning, Artifact primarily played covers of famous bands, but this was solely for practice, as they were constantly working on their own material. Some of the earliest songs written and performed were The Prophet and Native Land, both of which would later become part of Dead Silence. \n\nThe band played as a trio, a four-piece, and even attempted a five-member lineup. However, over time, one member was always falling behind, either due to a lack of commitment or a reluctance to fully get into thrash metal. \n\nThis led to the formation of Artifact’s core lineup, consisting of three dedicated members who gave their absolute best to the band: Volodymyr Ruzhak on vocals and guitar, Viktor Matushek on bass and backing vocals, and Igor Grant on drums and backing vocals. \n\nBy the time of their first live performance, they had already written a few original songs but still included some covers in their setlist. Several other songs were also performed at that concert, but the band eventually abandoned them in favor of a more distinct, Artifact-oriented sound.",

During this period, Artifact gained recognition in the Western Ukrainian metal scene and also achieved a milestone by securing third place in a national amateur metal competition held at the 'Lenin Rock Club' in Kyiv. \n\nFollowing this achievement, Artifact was featured in Western Ukraine's major magazine, EXPRESS, in an article titled 'Grandma Will Not Like It,' highlighting them as one of the top thrash metal bands in the region.

        description: "In 2011, Artifact began work on their debut album, Dead Silence, recorded at Artifact Studio and officially released in September 2012. The recording process was split into two key phases—tracking the instruments and vocals, followed by an extensive period of mastering and fine-tuning the sound. With a limited budget, the band dedicated countless hours to critical listening, refining the mix to achieve the best quality possible. Artifact set up their own recording space, allowing for a fully independent process where every member contributed with full strength and support. Unfortunately, one member left before the recording was completed, but the remaining trio pushed forward to finish the album. \n\nThroughout the recording, Iuliia Polinovska presented multiple artwork concepts, and after careful consideration, the band selected the final design, which visually captured the album’s haunting themes. In September 2012, Dead Silence was released online and as a limited edition audio CD. Shortly after its release, Artifact took a break as Volodymyr relocated to Canada, putting the band on hold.",

Though Artifact had been inactive for years, Volodymyr never stopped writing—storing melodies, structuring riffs in Guitar Pro, and drafting lyrics in preparation for a possible return. Silent Storm became the first step in testing whether he could take full creative control and produce music entirely on his own. The process proved successful, thanks to the encouragement of past band members and the visual artistry of Iuliia Polinovska, who designed the cover art. With renewed confidence, Artifact’s journey resumed, setting the stage for what would come next. \n\nAs fate would have it, Silent Storm was released in September 2022—exactly 10 years after Dead Silence. A coincidence? Maybe. Or perhaps Artifact was always meant to return.",

        description: "By 2022, with newfound independence, Volodymyr began working on new material, culminating in the 2024 album No One. The album was a deeply introspective work, fully recorded, mixed, and mastered by Volodymyr himself. No One delves into themes of isolation, identity, and resilience, capturing raw emotion both musically and lyrically. \n\nThe recording process was anything but linear. Initially unsure if the project would ever be completed, Volodymyr recorded chaotically, testing setups and refining his approach. The first track recorded, No Creation, served as an experiment to determine the workflow. As the process gained momentum, he found himself rehearsing and recording relentlessly, refining both lyrics and compositions along the way. \n\nAt the start, seven fully written tracks were ready, but the album's vision kept evolving. Determined to match the eleven-track structure of Dead Silence, four additional songs were composed during the recording phase. Drowning in Denial became the final piece, completed in January 2024 and recorded last. \n\nThroughout this journey, Volodymyr received unwavering support from original bandmates Igor Grant and Viktor Matushek, who encouraged him to push forward after hearing early demos. Iuliia Polinovska, a longtime collaborator, was also instrumental—not only in her encouragement but in crafting the album’s striking cover art. While Volodymyr spent 15 months fully immersed in writing, recording, and polishing the album, Iuliia worked on the visual concept from July to September 2024, completing it by early October. \n\nOn October 18, 2024, No One was officially released, marking a significant milestone in Artifact’s evolution.",
