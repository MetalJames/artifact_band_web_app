    // description: "Artifact is a Ukrainian thrash metal band founded in November 2005 in Lviv, Ukraine. The early days were filled with relentless practice, experimenting with sound, and finding the right balance. Through years of dedication, Artifact grew into a band that could proudly say—it was worth every step. \n\nOver time, the band evolved from blending heavy and thrash metal into a modernized, high-energy sound—Artifact Metal—fusing raw thrash intensity with groove-driven elements and drop D tuning. \n\nBy 2010, the band released its first demo, a milestone shaped by the dedication and musicianship of its core trio—Volodymyr Ruzhak (vocals, guitar, solo), Igor Grant (drums, backing vocals), and Viktor Matushek (bass, backing vocals). Each member brought their own energy and vision to the project, solidifying the foundation of what Artifact would become. \n\nThe band has released two full albums, Dead Silence (2012) and No One (2024), along with the instrumental single Silent Storm (2020).",
